## CONFIGURE ##

Breaks down into 4 steps:

1.) App

App section defines the basics, your name and your key.

2.) Data

Data is seperated into nodes.  The idea is so you can have an unlimited source of data.

Database data, or file data

3.) Databases

the configuration starts with the SAME name used to define a data node in the previous configuration step.  Then you define the connection type, host, etc.

4.) FileSystem

Same principle as the Databases.  Start by defining which node using the SAME name defined in Data.  Then designate your file system type and path.  The type advantage is so that you don't have to use a local file system.  You can use user-remote, amazon-remote, etc.# BrainPI
